# Investigation of Frangula alnus population dynamics through linked distribution and demographic models

This project is the transition of my work on Chapter 4 of my PhD dissertation to a submitted journal manuscript.
The initial commit includes direct copies of Chapter 4, taken from with the F-alnus directory structure on my Dropbox.
