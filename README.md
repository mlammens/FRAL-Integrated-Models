# Investigation of Frangula alnus population dynamics through linked distribution and demographic models

This project is the transition of my work on Chapter 4 of my PhD dissertation to a submitted journal manuscript.
The initial commit includes direct copies of Chapter 4, taken from with the F-alnus directory structure on my Dropbox.

My target journal for this project is [Diversity and Distributions](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1472-4642)

The information for authors can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1472-4642/homepage/ForAuthors.html)

## To-do

* Update literature search
* Edit document to cut 6000 words (it has to be half the current length!)
